DOBEL STUDIOS

Dobel Studios is a one-man passion-project building software studio designed on making games for the web.

THE GUY BEHIND THE ACCOUNT:

Hey. I'm Alotario, the main programmer at Dobel Studios. I make all the code for the games you play. Art is mostly done by a couple of buddies, and music is  done by Deacon Wolfe (he's the main composer for the Escape! soundtrack). I'm the only real guy running this little biz, so if you see my code and ever wanna help out, shoot me an email at alotariofinalgen@gmail.com.
